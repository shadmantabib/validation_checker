# Deployment Checklist

## üîê Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Local Development Setup
- [ ] `.env` file created with your SECRET_SALT
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (never commit it)
- [ ] Application runs locally with environment variables
- [ ] Database is created automatically on startup

### ‚úÖ Code Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [ ] All sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] Proper error messages for missing environment variables
- [ ] Security documentation is complete

### ‚úÖ Git Repository Preparation
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes `.env` file
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes `validation.db` file
- [ ] `env.example` file shows required variables (without actual values)
- [ ] README includes security instructions

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Generate Production Secret
```bash
# Generate a secure SECRET_SALT for production
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```
**Save this value** - you'll need it for your hosting platform.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Registration validation system"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/validation-check-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### Railway (Recommended)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Go to "Variables" tab
6. Add environment variables:
   - `SECRET_SALT`: Your generated 64-character hex string
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`

#### Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Set Build Command: `npm install`
6. Set Start Command: `npm start`
7. Add environment variables in "Environment" tab

#### Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables in project settings

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Database is created automatically
- [ ] Validation system works correctly
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic on hosting platforms)

## üîç Post-Deployment Security Check

### Test Your Deployment
1. **Visit your public URL**
2. **Test validation** with sample data
3. **Check browser console** for any errors
4. **Verify HTTPS** is working
5. **Test rate limiting** (try many requests quickly)

### Environment Variables Verification
```bash
# Your hosting platform should show these variables:
SECRET_SALT=your-64-character-hex-string
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=auto-assigned-by-platform
```

### Security Verification
- [ ] No `.env` file in your GitHub repository
- [ ] No `validation.db` file in your GitHub repository
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in your code
- [ ] Application shows proper error messages for missing env vars

## üö® Security Reminders

### Never Commit These Files:
- `.env` - Contains your secret salt
- `validation.db` - Contains your database
- Any files with actual passwords or keys

### Always Set These Environment Variables:
- `SECRET_SALT` - Critical for security
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Enables production optimizations

### For Each Environment:
- **Development**: Use `.env` file locally
- **Staging**: Set environment variables in staging platform
- **Production**: Set environment variables in production platform
- **Use different SECRET_SALT values** for each environment

## üîÑ Updating Your Deployment

### Code Updates
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main
```
Your hosting platform will automatically redeploy.

### Environment Variable Updates
1. Go to your hosting platform dashboard
2. Update environment variables
3. Restart your application (usually automatic)

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check your hosting platform logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure your GitHub repository doesn't contain sensitive files
4. Review the security checklist above

**Remember**: Security is paramount. Never commit sensitive information to version control!
